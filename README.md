Force directed Graph with:

1. Dragable nodes
2. Zoom and pan (with maximum effective-size limit for zoomed elements)
3. Double-click to center node
4. Resizable window (with zoom/pan-aware relocation of center of gravity)
5. Text labels (which are not occluded by nodes; flag to set centered/offset)
6. Properties determine node size and shape, and node and link colors (with default values; flag to set fill/outline). 
7. Filter nodes by shape (c,d,r,s,t,x), by score (l,h,m), if orphan (0), and filter links by score (1,2,3)
8. Hover to highlight 1st-order neighborhood. Click to fade surroundings
9. Read graph from json file
